# Activity 1: RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE

## Lua

This is a group activity that involves researching one of three programming languages: Processing, Haskell, and Lua, to answer specific questions.

Lua is a lightweight, efficient scripting language known for its simplicity, versatility, and embeddability. Originally designed for extending software applications, Lua is widely used in video game development, embedded systems, and scripting for various software projects. It prioritizes simplicity and performance, making it popular in environments where resource constraints are a concern. As of May 2021, Lua ranked 26th among the most searched programming languages on Google.

## What is the language used for?

Lua finds application in a variety of fields, including video game development, where its simplicity and efficiency are highly valued. It's often used for scripting within game engines to control game logic and behavior. Additionally, Lua is employed in embedded systems for its lightweight nature, allowing it to run on devices with limited resources. Beyond gaming and embedded systems, Lua is utilized for scripting tasks in software projects, providing a flexible and easy-to-use language for extending functionality.

## Who uses the language?

Lua is employed by developers in the gaming industry, particularly for scripting within game engines such as Unity and Roblox. Its lightweight and efficient nature also make it popular in embedded systems, where it's used in devices ranging from mobile phones to smart TVs and IoT devices. Furthermore, Lua is embraced by software developers for its simplicity and versatility in scripting tasks, finding use in applications like Adobe Lightroom and Wireshark.

## What are some useful resources?

For learning Lua, several resources are available to beginners and experienced developers alike. The official Lua website (lua.org) provides documentation, tutorials, and references essential for understanding the language. "Programming in Lua" by Roberto Ierusalimschy serves as a comprehensive guide for both novice and advanced users, covering fundamental concepts and advanced topics. Online platforms such as GitHub and Stack Overflow offer community-driven support and code repositories for Lua projects. To practice coding in Lua, websites like LeetCode and Codecademy offer interactive exercises and challenges tailored to the language.

## Why are these specific resources useful?

These resources are valuable for learning Lua due to their accessibility and depth of content. The official Lua website serves as a central hub for documentation and resources, offering essential information for beginners and experienced developers. "Programming in Lua" provides a structured approach to learning the language, covering foundational concepts and advanced techniques. Online platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow offer community support and collaboration opportunities, while interactive coding platforms like LeetCode and Codecademy facilitate hands-on learning and practice.

## Reflection

This activity proved to be an insightful exploration of Lua, enhancing our understanding of its applications and resources available for learning. By approaching the research with specific questions in mind, we were able to delve into various aspects of the language and discover its versatility and utility in different fields. Utilizing a range of websites during the search process provided diverse perspectives and enriched our understanding of Lua's usage and ecosystem.

# Activity 2: USER STORIES - FORMAT AND PROCESS

Facebook Marketplace is an online platform created by Facebook where users can buy, sell, and trade items with others in their local community. It provides a convenient way for people to discover, buy, and sell items such as clothing, electronics, furniture, vehicles, and more.

Key features of Facebook Marketplace include:

Local Listings: Users can browse items for sale in their local area, making it easy to find items nearby.

Categories and Filters: Items are organized into categories, and users can apply filters to narrow down their search based on location, price, category, and more.

Messaging: Buyers and sellers can communicate directly through Facebook Messenger to discuss details such as price, pickup arrangements, and item condition.

Safety and Privacy: Facebook provides tools and guidelines to help users stay safe while buying and selling on Marketplace, including user ratings and reporting features.

Integration with Facebook: Marketplace is integrated with Facebook's social network, allowing users to see listings from friends, groups, and pages they follow, as well as share listings with others.

##USER STORIES

I choose Facebook Marketplace for this acvity as i use it on daily basis:

USER STORIES FOR FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE

As a user, I want to browse through listings in the Facebook Marketplace to discover products and services that match my interests or needs.

As a seller, I want to create listings easily on the Facebook Marketplace, providing detailed descriptions and images to attract potential buyers.

As a buyer, I want to filter search results on the Facebook Marketplace by category, location, price range, and other relevant criteria to find specific items efficiently.

As a user, I want to communicate with sellers or buyers directly within the Facebook Marketplace platform to negotiate prices, ask questions, and arrange transactions.

As a seller, I want to receive notifications about inquiries, messages, and offers related to my listings on the Facebook Marketplace to stay informed and responsive.

As a buyer, I want to view seller ratings and reviews on the Facebook Marketplace to assess their credibility and trustworthiness before making a purchase.

As a user, I want to report inappropriate listings or behavior on the Facebook Marketplace to maintain a safe and respectful community environment.

As a buyer, I want to save listings on the Facebook Marketplace for later reference or comparison to streamline my shopping experience.

FUNCTIONAL USER REQUIREMENTS FOR FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE

The Facebook Marketplace should have a responsive and intuitive user interface that allows for easy navigation and browsing of listings across various devices.

Users should be able to create listings on the Facebook Marketplace by providing required information such as title, description, price, category, and images. Additionally, the platform should support features like scheduling availability and setting delivery options.

The Facebook Marketplace should include robust search and filter functionalities, allowing users to refine search results based on specific criteria and preferences.

The platform should facilitate seamless communication between buyers and sellers within the Marketplace interface, including messaging, negotiation, and transaction management features.

Sellers should receive timely notifications about inquiries, messages, and offers related to their listings, accessible through both the Facebook app and website.

The Facebook Marketplace should display seller ratings and reviews prominently on listings, allowing buyers to make informed decisions based on feedback from previous transactions.

Users should have access to reporting tools within the Facebook Marketplace to flag inappropriate content or behavior, with mechanisms in place for review and moderation by Facebook's community standards team.

The platform should offer a bookmarking or save feature, allowing users to bookmark listings for future reference and easy access from their Facebook account.

By identifying and defining these user stories and functional requirements, developers can better understand the needs and expectations of Facebook Marketplace users and create a more user-centered and functional product.

#Community Code Project Repo
 
In this part, I learned that contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any coding or documenting skills, bug fixes, or community support. We are given four different platforms, like Good First Issue, Github, Up for Grabs, and CodeTriage. I checked all the websites, but i decided to use github as, since day 1 of my college, i have been using github to submit my coding assignments. I am more familiar with it, and i was unaware of the explore feature of github. In this feature, we can see other community projects and we can also participate in them. Furthermore,  we can filter the projects according to the language. I selected Java for my Community Code Project because i did that in my last semester, and i am more familiar with it than other languages.
