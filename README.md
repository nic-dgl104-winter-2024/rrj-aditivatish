## Activity 1: RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE

## Lua

This is a group activity that involves researching one of three programming languages: Processing, Haskell, and Lua, to answer specific questions.

Lua is a lightweight, efficient scripting language known for its simplicity, versatility, and embeddability. Originally designed for extending software applications, Lua is widely used in video game development, embedded systems, and scripting for various software projects. It prioritizes simplicity and performance, making it popular in environments where resource constraints are a concern. As of May 2021, Lua ranked 26th among the most searched programming languages on Google.

## What is the language used for?

Lua finds application in a variety of fields, including video game development, where its simplicity and efficiency are highly valued. It's often used for scripting within game engines to control game logic and behavior. Additionally, Lua is employed in embedded systems for its lightweight nature, allowing it to run on devices with limited resources. Beyond gaming and embedded systems, Lua is utilized for scripting tasks in software projects, providing a flexible and easy-to-use language for extending functionality.

## Who uses the language?

Lua is employed by developers in the gaming industry, particularly for scripting within game engines such as Unity and Roblox. Its lightweight and efficient nature also make it popular in embedded systems, where it's used in devices ranging from mobile phones to smart TVs and IoT devices. Furthermore, Lua is embraced by software developers for its simplicity and versatility in scripting tasks, finding use in applications like Adobe Lightroom and Wireshark.

## What are some useful resources?

For learning Lua, several resources are available to beginners and experienced developers alike. The official Lua website (lua.org) provides documentation, tutorials, and references essential for understanding the language. "Programming in Lua" by Roberto Ierusalimschy serves as a comprehensive guide for both novice and advanced users, covering fundamental concepts and advanced topics. Online platforms such as GitHub and Stack Overflow offer community-driven support and code repositories for Lua projects. To practice coding in Lua, websites like LeetCode and Codecademy offer interactive exercises and challenges tailored to the language.

## Why are these specific resources useful?

These resources are valuable for learning Lua due to their accessibility and depth of content. The official Lua website serves as a central hub for documentation and resources, offering essential information for beginners and experienced developers. "Programming in Lua" provides a structured approach to learning the language, covering foundational concepts and advanced techniques. Online platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow offer community support and collaboration opportunities, while interactive coding platforms like LeetCode and Codecademy facilitate hands-on learning and practice.

## Reflection

This activity proved to be an insightful exploration of Lua, enhancing our understanding of its applications and resources available for learning. By approaching the research with specific questions in mind, we were able to delve into various aspects of the language and discover its versatility and utility in different fields. Utilizing a range of websites during the search process provided diverse perspectives and enriched our understanding of Lua's usage and ecosystem.
