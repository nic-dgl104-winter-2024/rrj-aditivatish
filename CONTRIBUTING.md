## Part 1: Assess External Communitie Contribution :
  For this part i choose the first issue which i found in Activity 4:IDENTIFY ISSUES TO SUPPORT. This issue aims to enhance the user interface (UI) for the "Sign Out" feature of the project.Lots of people tried to fix this issue. But as i am studying UX/UI in this semester i can suggest some key points how we can improve Button to make better UI:
  
  - Clear Labeling: Use a simple label like "Sign Out" or "Log Out" to show what the button does.

  - Easy to Find: Put the Sign Out button where users expect it, like in a menu or at the top of the page.

  - Distinctive Design: Make the button stand out with a different color or bold font.

  - Icon: Consider adding a small icon, like a door or power symbol, to help users recognize the button's function.

  - Size and Spacing: Make sure the button is big enough to tap on a touchscreen and isn't too close to other elements.

  - Hover Effect: Add a simple change in color or animation when users hover over the button to show it's clickable.

  - Confirmation: Consider adding a confirmation message to double-check if users really want to sign out.

  - Consistency: Keep the design and placement of the Sign Out button the same across your website for a consistent experience.

  - Accessibility: Ensure the button works well for everyone, including those who use screen readers or have trouble seeing colors.

  - Feedback: Listen to what users say about the Sign Out button and make adjustments based on their needs.

  By focusing on these simple improvements, we can make the buttons easier to use and understand for all your website visitors.


## Contribution and Detailed discussion of code review and outcomes : 
    I didn't contribute but i discussed these few points with my friends Sumit and Himanshu they added one more feature about Responsive 
     Design.
  - Responsive Design: Ensure that the Sign Out button and its surrounding UI elements adapt smoothly to different screen sizes and 
    devices.
    This involves using responsive design techniques to make the button accessible and usable across various devices, including desktops, 
    tablets, and smartphones.
    A responsive design ensures that the Sign Out button remains visible and functional regardless of the user's device, enhancing the 
    overall user experience.
## Development : 
    In this process i firstly visted the issue first then i read all the related things to it including other people's comments and 
    countributions. Then i get to know that the issue need basic fundamentals of UI designing as doing code can be easy for everyone but 
    without having the basic knowledge of User Interface design then its more diifucult. 
## Refection :
    I found balancing simplicity and functionality challenging while redesigning the Sign Out button. I addressed this by seeking user 
    feedback and experimenting with different designs. The outcome was a more intuitive and visually appealing button, with valuable 
    insights gained into user preferences and design principles.

## Part 2:Contribute to Internal community code :
   1. Browsed through open-source projects and stumbled upon a Java pattern library, which caught my interest because I had learned Java 
      in my last semester.

   2. Followed the instructions in the "Add Java implementation for Observer pattern" article (#35) in the Mini-Projects repository by 
      reading the Readme file and grasping the problem at hand.

  3. Forked the repository to my GitHub account, brought it onto my local machine by cloning it, and kicked off the setup process using 
     the instructional videos provided.

  4. Created a fresh branch named "Java-Observational-Pattern" to work on implementing the Java Observer instance as outlined in the 
     instructions.

  5. Delved into implementing the Java Observer, sticking to the requirements mentioned, although encountered some hurdles, especially in 
     understanding the complexities involved.

  6. Tackled these challenges by diving into relevant documentation and seeking help from online resources, eventually triumphing over 
     the obstacles and successfully completing the task.


During all this activity we are enaged with each other and on other site our instructors are also included in this they were sharing there output's or feedbacks on my work which i found intersting because by this activity i got more engaed in the pattern library activity.
